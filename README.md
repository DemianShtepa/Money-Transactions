# Money transactions service

There is a simple transactions service. Implemented authorization via login and password.
User can have several valets. Implemented transactions between wallets with 1.5% commission.
Multiple currencies supported(BTC, ETH).

Project created for demo purposes, not ready for production usage.

# Requirements

You need to implement a backend application that would allow users to transfer funds
between wallets. On every transaction, the system will need to take a commission of
1.5%.

- Create a relational database schema

- Upon application start, the database should be populated with sample data (e.g
several wallets that can be used to transfer funds between)

- The system should support two currency: BTC and ETH

- Create a REST endpoint that can be used to transfer funds

- Provide a docker-compose.yml that can be used to run your solution by just
doing â€‹docker-compose up

# Run locally (without docker)

1  . Clone repository

```
git clone https://github.com/DemianShtepa/money-transactions-service.git
```

2 . Install dependencies

```
cd money-transactions-service
docker-compose up -d
```

3 . Create database user

```
CREATE USER 'paxful'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'paxful';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON paxful.* TO 'paxful'@'localhost';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON paxful_test.* TO 'paxful'@'localhost';
```

4 . Set database settings

```
# nano .env
DATABASE_URL="mysql://paxful:paxful@127.0.0.1:3306/paxful?serverVersion=5.7"
```

```
# nano .env.test
DATABASE_URL="mysql://paxful:paxful@127.0.0.1:3306/paxful_test?serverVersion=5.7"
```

5 . Create databases:

```
php bin/console doctrine:database:create
php bin/console doctrine:database:create --env=test
```

6 . Apply migarations

```
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --env=test
```

5 . Run local dev server

```
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 public/index.php
```

# Load sample data:

```
php bin/console sample-data:load
```

# Run tests:

```
./bin/phpunit
```

# Api reference
# Usage

1 . Health check.

```
curl --request GET \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:18680/
```

2 . Create transaction from user 1 to user 2

```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:18680/transaction \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --header 'password: user1' \
  --header 'username: user1@test.com' \
  --data '{
	"source": 1,
	"destination": 3,
	"amount": 1
}'
```

2 . Create transaction from user 2 to user 1

```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:18680/transaction \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --header 'password: user2' \
  --header 'username: user2@test.com' \
  --data '{
	"source": 3,
	"destination": 1,
	"amount": 1
}'
```

# DB connection

Host: localhost

Database: paxful

User: paxful

Password: paxful

# Tests

```
docker-compose exec php-fpm ./bin/phpunit
```

# Disclaimer

- I have problems with running tests in docker container, trying to resolve.
For now, I run tests locally. There are only functional tests. I would need more time for unit tests implementation.

- I use float for price. I think, it's not the best approach, but I think, it's out of scope for this task.
I would use some specific doctrine type, or some php library for money processing.

- For now there are no access tokens, I use email/password for authentication
